# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## User Story
- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist

## Description
This is a work day scheduler that allows users to store any items according to the time for the day. For example, if the user wanted to add a 4 pm doctor's appointment on their calendar for the day, they can type it in the appropriate time slot and save the information. Users won't have to worry about losing any information if they refresh the page, as any items saved are stored unless the "clear fields" button is used to clear all items. Each time slot for the day is highlighted in one of three colors: green for current hour, red for future hours, and gray for past hours.
